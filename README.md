### Plain Mad Libs
```
It was during the battle of foundation when I was running through a tank when a external went off right next to my platoon. Our Appraiser yelled for us to beam to the nearest Dillsboro we could find. When we got to the Dillsboro we pressed to start a fire. As we were starting the fire the enemy saw the welcome from the fire and started bleaching reply at us. we all quickly ducked behind the ball at the Dillsboro and returned fire. we quickly eliminated the enemy and were furious that we had won the battle.

### Mad Libs + GPT-J
```
One day, a little squirrel perhaps sat on a blink, splattered with rain drops, and thought about it. Perhaps he thought the world would be simpler if only we could all know how to blink. Perhaps he thought, just perhaps, it would make life easier to just blink like everyone else. From this time on, squirrel tried to embrace each thing. But it was hard, so it took him quite some time. some pages we want to show you, but they are too small/waiting
